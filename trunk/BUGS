more important bugs at the top...


* no important bug known at this time :-)

* since "override countries" (overridden via query paramter)  are not resolved into region,
  a wrong region is given in generated mirror lists:

     http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/11.1/repo/oss/suse/noarch/rubygem-rails-2.1.1-1.14.noarch.rpm?mirrorlist&country=ZA
     Found 2 mirrors which handle this country (ZA): <- ok
     Found 61 mirrors in other countries, but same continent (EU): <- wrong

* mirrorlist give inaccurate readings for "number of mirrors", if some mirrors
  where not considered, because they are configured country-only or region-only 
  (same_region=1 or same_country=1)

  As further effect of this bug, I just noticed that a mirror is missing from
  the ?mirrorlist mirror lists if it is configured as fallback mirror for a
  country:
    http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/KDE4:/STABLE:/Desktop/openSUSE_11.1/KDE4-DEVEL.ymp?mirrorlist&country=tw
    ftp5 disappears from the list, when configured as fallback for Taiwan. It is
    correctly used though and appears on th list when actually used as fallback.
