more important bugs at the top...


* no important bug known at this time :-)
  but there are some:

* country_only mirrors show up in metalinks

* mod_geoip should be required as mod_form - and Apache should check at
  startup. On the other hand, it could be optional, because mod_mirrorbrain
  also works without mod_geoip (distributing requests world-wide, according to
  mirror priorities). So it could be a valid use case to run without mod_geoip.
  On the other hand, at least a warning should be issued, so admins get a hint when
  mod_geoip was simply forgotten. On the other hand, we could have a check that
  prevents starting, unless geoip usage is explicitely disabled (e.g.
  MirrorBrainRequireGeoIP off)

* since "override countries" (overridden via query paramter)  are not resolved into region,
  a wrong region is given in generated mirror lists:

     http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/11.1/repo/oss/suse/noarch/rubygem-rails-2.1.1-1.14.noarch.rpm?mirrorlist&country=ZA
     Found 2 mirrors which handle this country (ZA): <- ok
     Found 61 mirrors in other countries, but same continent (EU): <- wrong

* mirrorlist give inaccurate readings for "number of mirrors", if some mirrors
  where not considered, because they are configured country-only or region-only 
  (same_region=1 or same_country=1)

  As further effect of this bug, I just noticed that a mirror is missing from
  the ?mirrorlist mirror lists if it is configured as fallback mirror for a
  country:
    http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/KDE4:/STABLE:/Desktop/openSUSE_11.1/KDE4-DEVEL.ymp?mirrorlist&country=tw
    ftp5 disappears from the list, when configured as fallback for Taiwan. It is
    correctly used though and appears on th list when actually used as fallback.
