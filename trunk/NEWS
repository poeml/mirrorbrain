- updated database schemes and toolchain -- PostgreSQL support is solid now
- work on installation documentation for both MySQL and PostgreSQL
  (the latter is recommended now, because it allows for nifty features in the
  future. The mb tool has an export subcommand now, perfect to migrate the
  database.)
- toolchain work


Tue Feb  3 10:38:02 CET 2009
- version 2.5
- working on PostgreSQL support
- working on the INSTALL documentation
- scanner: 0.22
   - more efficient SQL statement handling
   - output much improved
   - added SQL logging option for debugging
- mb (mirrorbrain tool): 
   - bugfix in the file command: make patterns work which have a wildcard as
     first character.
   - extend "mb scan" to accept -v and --sql-debug and pass it to the scanner


Fri Jan 23 17:20:00 CET 2009
- version 2.4
- rename mod_zrkadlo to mod_mirrorbrain
- use mod_geoip for GeoIP lookups, instead of doing it ourselves. We can now use
  the GeoIP city database for instance 
- handle satellite "country" called A2
- auto-reenable dead mirrors
- geoiplookup_city added, new tool to show details from GeoIP city databases
- geoip-lite-update tool updated, with adjusted URL for GeoLite databases. It
  also downloads the city database now.
- deprecate "clientip" query parameter, which can no longer work
  once we use mod_geoip. Implement 'country" parameter that can be used instead.
- make memcache support optional at compile time


Sat Dec 13 20:04:53 CET 2008
- add commandline tool to edit marker files. (Marker files are used to generate
  mirror lists. Each marker file is used to determine whether a mirror mirrors
  a certain subtree.)

Sat Dec 13 13:51:33 CET 2008
- improvements and few features in the toolchain:
   - the mirrorprobe now does GET requests instead of HEAD requests.
   - mb, the mirrorbrain tool, has a powerful "probefile" command now that can
     check for existance of a file on all mirrors, probing all URLs. This is
     especially useful for checking whether the permission setup for staged 
     content is correct on all mirrors.
- new database fields: public_notes, operator_name, operator_url
- new database tables: country & region

Sat Dec  6 12:15:13 CET 2008
- generate mirror lists

Sat Nov 22 15:58:46 CET 2008
- release MirrorBrain 2.2:
  - simplified database layout, with additional space save.

Sun Nov  9 15:20:03 CET 2008
- release MirrorBrain 2.1
  - simplified the Apache configuration: It is no longer needed to configure a
    database query. At the same time it's less error-prone and avoids trouble
    if one forgets to update the query, when the database schema changes. 
  - specific mirrors can be now configured to get only requests for files < n bytes

Mon Nov  3 11:04:04 CET 2008
- release MirrorBrain 2.0
  - implement better fallback mirror selection
  - add tool to list/add/rm files in the mirror database

Sun Oct 26 18:07:52 CET 2008
- mod_zrkadlo 1.9:
  - add bittorrent links (to found .torrent files) into metalinks
  - embed PGP signatures (.asc files) into metalinks
  - add configurable CSS stylesheet to mirror lists

Fri Sep 19 21:08:42 CET 2008
 - implement the redirection exceptions (file too small, mime type not allowed
   to be redirected etc) for transparently negotiated metalinks.
 - add Vary header on all transparently negotiated resources.
- new, better implementation of rsyncusers tool
- improved mirrordoctor tool
- bugfixes in the scanner, mainly for scanning via HTML
- installation instructions updated

Fri Aug 22 17:22:14 CEST 2008
- allow to use the apache module and all tools with multiple instances of
  the mirrorbrain. Now, one machine / one Apache can host multiple separate
  instances, each in a vhost.
- a number of small bugs in the tools were fixed and several improvements
  added.

Wed Jun 11 01:20:12 CEST 2008
- added "mirrordoctor", a commandline tool to maintain mirror entries in the
  database. Finally!

Mon Jun  2 17:30:45 CEST 2008
- mod_zrkadlo 1.8:
  use mod_memcache for the configuration and initialization of memcache
- metalink-hasher script added, to prepare hashes for injection into metalink files
- rsyncusers analysis tool added
- scanner bugfix regarding following redirects for large file checks

Fri May  2 18:54:09 CEST 2008
- failover testbed for text mirrorlists implemented
- rsyncinfo tool added

Wed Apr 30 19:34:31 CEST 2008
- metalinks: switch back to RFC822 format
- new ZrkadloMetalinkPublisher directive 
- fix issue with <size> element

Sun Apr 27 23:02:42 CEST 2008
- now there is another (more natural) way to request a metalink: by appending
  ".metalink" to the filename.

Sun Apr 27 12:06:47 CEST 2008
- change metalink negotiation to look for application/metalink+xml in the
  Accept header (keep Accept-Features for now, but it is going to be removed
  probably)

Mon Apr 21 17:35:27 CEST 2008
- new terse text-based mirrorlist
- allow clients to use RFC2295 Accept-Features header to select variants
  (metalink or mirrorlist-txt)


Mon Apr 21 01:35:31 CEST 2008
metalink hash includes can now be out-of-tree

Sat Apr 19 18:21:52 CEST 2008
mod_autoindex_mb

Sat Apr 19 18:21:52 CEST 2008
content-disposition header
