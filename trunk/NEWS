- improvements and few features in the toolchain:
   - the mirrorprobe now does GET requests instead of HEAD requests.
   - mb, the mirrorbrain tool, has a powerful "probefile" command now that can
     check for existance of a file on all mirrors, probing all URLs. This is
     especially useful for checking whether the permission setup for staged 
     content is correct on all mirrors.
- new database fields: public_notes, operator_name, operator_url
- new database tables: country & region

Sat Dec  6 12:15:13 CET 2008

- release MirrorBrain 2.2:
  - simplified database layout, with additional space save.

Sun Nov  9 15:20:03 CET 2008
- release MirrorBrain 2.1
  - simplified the Apache configuration: It is no longer needed to configure a
    database query. At the same time it's less error-prone and avoids trouble
    if one forgets to update the query, when the database schema changes. 
  - specific mirrors can be now configured to get only requests for files < n bytes

Mon Nov  3 11:04:04 CET 2008

- bugfixes in the scanner, mainly for scanning via HTML

Fri Aug 22 17:22:14 CEST 2008
- allow to use the apache module and all tools with multiple instances of
  the mirrorbrain. Now, one machine / one Apache can host multiple separate
  instances, each in a vhost.
- a number of small bugs in the tools were fixed and several improvements
  added.

Wed Jun 11 01:20:12 CEST 2008

- now there is another (more natural) way to request a metalink: by appending
  ".metalink" to the filename.

Sun Apr 27 12:06:47 CEST 2008
- change metalink negotiation to look for application/metalink+xml in the
  Accept header (keep Accept-Features for now, but it is going to be removed
  probably)

- new terse text-based mirrorlist
- allow clients to use RFC2295 Accept-Features header to select variants
