mod_autoindex_mb is a patched mod_autoindex. It adds a little further
capability as index option.

The provided mod_autoindex.c.patch shows the differences to the original module.
This patch is *not* meant to be applied to mod_autoindex in the httpd source tree.
It merely serves to illustrate in which way mod_autoindex_mb differs from
mod_autoindex.

Only one module can be loaded at a time - either mod_autoindex or mod_autoindex_mb.
The two modules can not usefully run side by side, because they share the same 
configuration directives.
The module name differs, so that it can be explicit which module is loaded.


The module can be compiled like this:
apxs2 -c '-Wc,-Wall -g -D_GNU_SOURCE' mod_autoindex_mb.c

(I can't remember why I needed the _GNU_SOURCE. It was on Linux and was probably
related to filesystem access. The module should work on any platform, of course.)
