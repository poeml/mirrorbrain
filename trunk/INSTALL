These are instructions how to install mod_zrkadlo, the redirector module for apache.
The module understands query arguments (optionally appended to the URL) for 
diagnostic or other uses. See the config example for details.


It requires a backend to work with, which can be found at
https://forgesvn1.novell.com/svn/opensuse/trunk/tools/download-redirector-v2

RPM packages are here:
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Apache:/Modules/
http://club.mandriva.com/xwiki/bin/view/rpms/Application/apache-mod_zrkadlo

It requires libGeoIP, libapr_memcache, and mod_form.
It can be built with
apxs2 -c -lGeoIP -lapr_memcache -Wc,"-Wall -g -D_GNU_SOURCE" mod_zrkadlo.c


Sorry, the rest of the installation instructions is missing here. I hope I can
add them soon!
