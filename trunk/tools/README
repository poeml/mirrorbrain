This directory contains some tools that are used by the "mb" tool, or are
packaged just for conveniency.



Needed by "mb" (and therefore required to be placed within $PATH) are:

    geoiplookup_continent.c   
       A minimal clone of the "standard" geoiplookup tool (which comes with GeoIP),
       just that it can print out the continent, which the standard tool can't.
       Install it to /usr/bin/geoiplookup_continent
  
    scanner.pl
       The scanner, for now written in Perl, which is integral part of MirrorBrain.
       Install it as /usr/bin/scanner
  

Optional tools:

    geoip-lite-update
       Can fetch updated databases from GeoIP

    metalink-hasher.py
       Creates hashes for automatic inclusion into metalinks



Additional tools that may or may not be useful for operators of MirrorBrain, or
of a mirror infrastructure in general. You can ignore them for a MirrorBrain
install:

    create_timestamp
       Creates a small file containing a timestamp which can be used to let it
       spread to mirrors, so to check them for uptodate-ness.

    geoiplookup_city.c
       Show details from a city GeoIP database, similar to what the standard
       geoiplookup tool does, but also shows the continent.

    mirrorprobe-logrotate
       Logrotate snippet for the /var/log/mirrorbrain/mirrorprobe.log file

    push2mirrors
       Skeleton script to push content to mirrors, via rsync, in parallel.

    rsyncusers
       Tool to summarize rsync uses from an rsync log file
    rsyncusers.sh
       Same tool in a more stupid but more portable shell implementation

    rsyncinfo
       Tool to assess the size of rsync modules on a remote server, or a
       subdirectory

    bdecode
       Parse a Torrent file (or other BEncoded input), and pretty-print it.
       Can read from standard input: curl -s <url> | bdecode
       Useful to work on the Torrent generator in mod_mirrorbrain.
