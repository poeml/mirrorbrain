See http://mirrorbrain.org/download-statistics/ for background information on
this module (and possible further plans).


The Apache module isn't usable at this time. Instructions how to build it
are here just for archive purposes:

    # packages:
    
    http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Apache:/Modules/
    
    
    # build and install man manually:
    
    sudo apxs2 -ci -Wc,"-Wall -g" mod_stats.c
    
    a2enmod dbd
    a2enmod stats
    
    copy mod_dbd.conf to /etc/apache2 and include it server-wide (via
    /etc/sysconfig/apache2:APACHE_CONF_INCLUDE_FILES)
    
    copy contents of mod_stats.conf into your virtual host configuration.
    
    


Archiving and pruning old data from the 'stats_counter' table:

pg_dump -U mb -t stats_counter > stats_counter-20101004.dump
delete from stats_counter where date between E'2009-01-01 00:00:00' and E'2010-08-31 23:59:59.999999';
vacuum full stats_counter;
