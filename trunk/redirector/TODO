evaluate if it makes sense to memcache database query results, which may not be
practicable for all objects, but for some particular objects, like those with
mime type application/x-cd-image. They should not be cached for a significant
amount of time, but a few minutes shouldn't be a problem.
As a key for the memcache object, one could use the label of the prepared SQL
statement combined with the filename.

stickyness of (large) files to certain mirrors, to make better use of buffer caches?

test whether usage of explicit ap_dbd_open/ap_dbd_close, instead of the
ap_dbd_acquire wrapping function, results in better utilization of the database
connection pool

12:18 < DuDE> niq: I have a question. I am using two apache modules, one in the handler phase and one in the logging phase. Both use ap_dbd_acquire. Does that make sense?
12:18 < DuDE> niq: or is it better to use open/close explicitely?
12:19 < DuDE> niq: I read the acquired connection needs to stay "clean and unencumbered" to be able to use acquire, but I don't understand exactly what this means
13:38 -!- nick_ [n=nick@walkham.free-online.co.uk] has quit [Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)]
13:44 < niq> that should be fine
13:48 < DuDE> acquire should be fine?
14:00 < niq> yep
14:01 < niq> just so long as you don't leave things like dangling cursors or transactions
14:02 < DuDE> niq: okay
14:05 < DuDE> niq: would I get a dangling cursor, if I do a apr_dbd_pvselect, and don't read the complete results (with apr_dbd_get_row)?
14:05 < niq> yes
14:06 < DuDE> niq: okay
14:06 < DuDE> niq: thanks
14:06 < niq> if you don't want to loop-until-done, you can execute a random-access select, then read an invalid row to kill the cursor
