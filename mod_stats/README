Q: use delayed inserts?
A: no, insert are not done really often by this module.

Q: use delayed updates (updates are frequent)?
A: there _are_ no "delayed updates", only "low-priority" updates with mysql,
but they couuld be postponed forever and never happen. And the updates don't
really happen often, they don't (with msyql) lock the table if the InnoDB
engine is used and the table is maybe not even read more than once a day.
