Documentation for Developers
============================


If you are contributing to the MirrorBrain project, please read this first.


Participating in the community
------------------------------

The community exists mainly through mailing lists and a Subversion repository.
To participate:

Go to http://mirrorbrain.org/communication/ and join the "mirrorbrain",
"mirrorbrain-commits", and "mirrorbrain-announce" mailing lists. The dev list,
"mirrorbrain", is where almost all discussion takes place. All development
questions should go there, though you might want to check the list archives
first. The "mirrorbrain-commits" list receives automated commit emails.

Get a copy of the latest development sources from
http://svn.mirrorbrain.org/svn/mirrorbrain/trunk/.  New development always
takes place on trunk. Bugfixes, enhancements, and new features might be
backported from there to the various release branches.

How to work on the documentation is described in :ref:`hacking_the_docs`.
