This file is relatively obsolete. Issues are tracked in the issue tracker
meanwhile, which can be found here:
http://mirrorbrain.org/issues

Missing features:

* mb probefile: follow redirects. Testcase:
  http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/opensuse/factory/iso/openSUSE-NET-i586-Build0138-Media.iso
  which "blindly" redirects to an FTP server (by URL rewriting), but the file isn't there.
  see http://diveintopython.org/http_web_services/redirects.html for some ideas/details

* mirrorprobe: does it deal with FTP urls entered as baseurl (which is meant for HTTP)?

* make MirrorBrainExcludeNetwork work by prefix match, instead of simple string
  prefix comparison using apr_ipsubnet_create() and apr_ipsubnet_test() as 
  mod_authz_host does?

* make installation easier, by providing Makefiles, and a setup.py for the Python module.


Improvements:

* rewrite debugLog(r, cfg, ...) as macro which checks for cfg->debug==1 before
  caling ebugLog()

* check whether the maxconnections metalink attribute should be included, so that
  aria2c downloads from more than one server even when every server has a distinct
  preference value.


* ?mirrorlist mirror lists: set Vary header on X-AS?
  make it more cacheable?
  Cf. http://redbot.org/?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fdownload.opensuse.org%2Frepositories%2FApache%2FFedora_10%2FApache.repo%3Fmirrorlist
  Metalinks:
  make them less cacheable?

* check if the Vary header on Accept is added on all requests!

Further ideas:

* evaluate if it makes sense to memcache database query results, which may not be
  practicable for all objects, but for some particular objects, like those with
  mime type application/x-cd-image. They should not be cached for a significant
  amount of time, but a few minutes shouldn't be a problem.
  As a key for the memcache object, one could use the label of the prepared SQL
  statement combined with the filename.

* stickyness of (large) files to certain mirrors, to make better use of buffer caches?

* collect statistics on number and volume (cumulated file sizes) of redirects
  for mod_status, show per mirror identifier since last restart
